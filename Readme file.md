# Production Line Project with TIA Portal

## Overview
In this project, we successfully designed, programmed, and simulated a fully automated production line using **Siemens TIA Portal** and **Factory I/O**. The system incorporated advanced technologies like **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)** and **Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)** to efficiently manage and monitor a complete manufacturing process.

## Project Summary
The production line is designed to handle three main tasks: **sorting, machining, and assembly**. It starts by feeding raw materials, which are sorted by color and type, processed into parts (**lids and bases**), and finally assembled into finished products. The entire system is controlled by **state diagrams** and **ladder logic**, ensuring smooth coordination between stations.

### Key Features
- **Pick and Place Sorting Station:** Materials are sorted by color and transported to machining centers.
- **Machining Center:** Two parallel machining centers manufacture lids and bases from raw materials.
- **Sorting Station:** A vision sensor ensures lids and bases are organized by color for assembly.
- **Assembly Station:** Lids and bases are combined into finished products, ensuring matching colors.

## Achievements
- **Efficient System Design:** The use of state diagrams and function blocks simplified programming and troubleshooting, making the system efficient and reliable.
- **Realistic Simulation:** Factory I/O provided a safe environment to test and optimize the production line without physical equipment.
- **Comprehensive Automation:** Siemens TIA Portal allowed seamless PLC programming and HMI development, ensuring intuitive control and real-time monitoring.
- **Fault Detection:** The system included emergency stops and alarms for detecting hardware or process errors, enhancing safety and reliability.
- **Optimized Performance:** Conveyor speeds were dynamically controlled based on queue status, preventing bottlenecks and improving productivity.
